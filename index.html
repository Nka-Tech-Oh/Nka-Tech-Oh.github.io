        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nkateko Mongoni, a dedicated software development student at WeThinkCode_, where I'm mastering front-end, back-end, and full-stack development while working on real-world projects. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me to create innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.

            With a background as a system administrator, I bring strong technical expertise in maintaining system performance, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring data integrity and security. This hands-on experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in managing complex systems and a keen attention to detail.
            
            In addition to my technical skills, I have a deep commitment to community service. As a facilitator for the City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Services, I trained communities in fire safety and first aid, equipping individuals with essential life-saving skills. I am also proud to be an alumnus of the Activate Change Drivers program, where I developed leadership abilities and a passion for driving positive change.
            
            I am excited about the potential of technology to solve real-world problems, and I am eager to contribute to impactful projects that make a difference. Whether through coding or community work, my goal is to combine my technical and leadership skills to create meaningful solutions for the challenges we face today.</p>
